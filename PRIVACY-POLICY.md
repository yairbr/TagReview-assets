# Privacy Policy


TagReview is a project designed to improve and enhance the code review process by tagging review comments and categorizing review aspects. This helps users ensure all relevant topics are addressed, leading to better code quality and overall professional growth.

Currently, TagReview operates entirely on the client side and does not connect to any external sources or servers. No data is collected, stored, or transmitted.

In the future, we may introduce a server-side component to enhance collaboration, enforce review policies, and improve communication. Such features may require the collection and storage of comments, usernames, and other relevant metadata. Additionally, data may be processed by models for further analysis. If a backend system is introduced, this privacy policy will be updated accordingly.

Regardless of future updates, TagReview will never collect personal information, proprietary code, or any sensitive data with the intent of disclosure.
